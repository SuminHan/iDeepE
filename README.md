#DeepE: Inferring RNA-protein binding sites and motifs using local and global convolutional neural network
 

Download the trainig and testing data from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/GraphProt_CLIP_sequences.tar.bz2 and compress it in current dir.

Now it supports GPUs and 3 models, including CNNs, CNN-LSTM and ResNet, they can be trained using local CNNs and global CNNs, and alos ensembling of local and global CNNs.
